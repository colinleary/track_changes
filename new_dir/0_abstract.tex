The design of the Tachometer for Sheaff's Buddy's Boat (TFSBB), a tachometer for a Celebrity Champion power boat, is described. A tachometer is a device that shows how fast an engine is turning. Most tachometers simply display the engine speed, however the TFSBB also reads sensors from a gasoline engine and displays the results to a  detachable LCD display. The TFSBB met all specifications with a 5V DC-DC power supply and detachable display capable of showing engine revolutions per minute, engine temperature and oil pressure, and battery voltage. Primarily, the TFSBB drove an analog gauge to an accuracy of within 100 revolutions per minute.
