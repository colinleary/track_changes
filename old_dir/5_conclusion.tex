This report discussed the purpose and design of the Tachometer for Sheaff's Buddy's Boat. This project not only provided a solution to a failed tachometer on the Champion Celebrity power boat, it modernized the boat into the digital world. In testing, this project met or exceeded all contract specifications. Additionally, the detachable display that displayed engine oil pressure and temperature, battery voltage, and engine RPM was made to be hot swappable. With the final revision of the printed circuit board, the tachometer functioned as desired and was delivered to the customer.
