\subsection*{Summary}
A tachometer is to be built which will be capable of driving an analog tachometer gauge. The specified project has a DC-DC converter that converts nominal 12V to 3.3V $\pm5\%$ to run the microcontroller and other components. The tachometer shall be constructed on a PCB and can not utilize a development board. The gauge will be accurate to 100RPM between 1000RPM and 4000RPM. The specification makes the gauge most accurate in a typical operating range.

\subsection*{Inputs \& Outputs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item RPM signal
